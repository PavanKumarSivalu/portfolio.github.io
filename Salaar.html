It’s got some pretty solid Tollywood action set pieces, but nothing here is particularly brutal or violent or vicious. It’s just some hard-hitting fisticuffs amidst a lot of talking.

            But when you get to the third hour, everything comes together.
            
            In the climactic act of Salaar, we start seeing limbs flying off of people, some villains getting spikes rammed up through their jaws, and the blood just generally flows mercilessly. The promised gore really hits the fan if you are patient enough with Salaar to wait for it. 
            
            There is even a sudden tonal shift where the movie almost shifts genres for fifteen minutes or so and becomes a straight-on horror flick, as Deva and Vardharaja go up against a swarm of zombified warriors. It’s almost funny how our heroes don’t care that these men are being drugged into mindless violence; they just blast through them, swords a-swinging. But hey, it allows the movie to deliver even further on the promised viciousness as they do so!.</p>
